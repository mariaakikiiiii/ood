# Library Management System

## Overview
This Library Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to manage a library where items (books, newspapers, DVDs) can be bought or borrowed. The system consists of different user types, including **Managers**, **Librarians**, and **Customers**, who interact with the library in various ways.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Managers, Librarians, and Customers can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Item Management:** Books, DVDs, and newspapers can be added, bought, or borrowed.
- **Customer Actions:** Customers can buy items, borrow items, and manage memberships.
- **Librarian Actions:** Librarians can manage the library and oversee transactions.
- **Manager Actions:** Managers can create and delete librarians, set salaries, and manage the library system.
- **Balance Management:** Customers have a balance they can use to purchase items or memberships.

## How It Works
1. **User Signup/Login**
   - Customers, librarians, and managers can sign up with their details.
   - A customer can buy a membership for discounts.
   - Users can log in using their phone number and password.

2. **Buying & Borrowing Items**
   - Customers can buy books, DVDs, and newspapers if they have enough balance.
   - Borrowed items must be returned within a specific period.

3. **Library & User Management**
   - Librarians oversee inventory and customer transactions.
   - Managers handle librarian and manager roles, salaries, and overall system management.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better interaction.
- Add a database to store user data and item inventory.
- Introduce overdue penalties for borrowed items.
- Improve security by hashing passwords.
